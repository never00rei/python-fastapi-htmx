# python-fastapi-htmx

## Preface

This is an experiment with Python, FastAPI and HTMX. This has been pulled from: <https://testdriven.io/blog/fastapi-htmx/>

## Getting Started

1. `python -m venv .venv`
2. `source .venv/bin/activate`
3. `pip install -r requirements.txt`
4. `cd pythonhtmxpoc && fastapi dev app.py`

The development server will spin up a service that listens on localhost port 8000. Once running you should be able to visit the service via <http://localhost:8000>.
